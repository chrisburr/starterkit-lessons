# First Steps in LHCb

This is the LHCb Starterkit, a series of lessons for getting analysts working
confidently with LHCb data and software.
The lessons are best approached one after the other, as most lessons build on
the knowledge gained from the previous ones.

If you have any problems or questions, you can [send an email to
`lhcb-starterkit@cern.ch`](mailto:lhcb-starterkit@cern.ch).

{% callout "Prerequisites" %}
Before starting, you should be familiar with using a shell, like `bash`, and
with programming in Python.

The [Software Carpentry
workshop](http://twitwi.github.io/2015-06-02-cern-lhcb/) gives a great
introduction to these, as well as to many other useful computing tools.
